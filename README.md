1. **Vite & React.js**: Vite will be your build tool, offering fast build times and efficient development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). React.js acts as your front-end library, enabling you to create a dynamic user interface that updates in real-time as users interact with your application.

2. **React Icons**: You'll integrate this for aesthetically pleasing and responsive icons to enhance user interaction.

3. **Supabase**: By using Supabase for authentication, database, and file storage, you'll get a ready-to-use backend. It will manage user sign-ins, store booking details, and cabin information securely and efficiently.

4. **React Query**: This will help you manage server state, fetch, cache, and update data without having to write much boilerplate code, thereby improving user experience with background updates and optimistic UI updates.

5. **React Error Boundary**: Integrating React Error Boundary will prevent the entire app from crashing. It will catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

6. **React Hook Form**: This will facilitate form handling, validation, and submission with minimal re-rendering. It will help you build smooth and performant forms for bookings, guest check-ins, and cabin listings.

7. **React Router (Dom)**: This will allow you to manage navigation and routing within your web app. It will enable the creation of a multi-page feel within a single-page app, allowing users to bookmark pages like individual cabin details or booking confirmations.

8. **Styled Components**: Styled components offer scoped styling for your components, which will help you maintain a consistent look throughout your application while encapsulating each componentâ€™s styles, thus preventing style conflicts.

9. **Recharts**: A charting library built on React components will help you visualize booking trends, occupancy rates, and other relevant data for internal use by hotel management or staff.

Each part of your technology stack contributes to creating a highly interactive and scalable web application. Always keep user experience in mind: efficiency, intuitiveness, and responsiveness are key. Ensure that the authentication is secure, the routes are well-defined, the UI is clean, and the data fetching is as seamless as possible for real-time updates. Finally, good error handling can greatly improve the stability and reliability of your app. Once you have the structure of your app in place, you can iterate on user feedback to refine features and user experience.
